# routerview
A (maybe too) compact script for getting information on connected interfaces

<i><h1>Why?</h1></i>
  - it can come in handy for figuring out devices on your network
  - faster than an ARP scan and less resource-heavy on other computers (it also doesn't set off ARP scan detections)
  - you can figure out information about your router (BETA)
  
<i><h1>What?</h1></i>
 - routerview is a quick network and router enumeration tool
 - currently, routerview can :<br>
        - wait for a connection on an interface and then run a DNS scan<br>
        - show all connected interfaces/show all interfaces<br>
        - run a DNS scan on an interface (get all devices on network by cycling through ip addresses and asking the router)<br>
        - enumerate router info (BETA)<br>
        - get all information on saved Wi-Fi profiles (SSIDs and passwords)<br>
        - save everything to a log file<br>
